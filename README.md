My master's thesis delved into the prediction of soil properties, including Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), P, Mg, K, Clay, and Sand, within a test field situated in eastern Germany. 
Conducted at the Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy in Potsdam, the research utilized a VIS-NIR spectrometer. Our primary challenge lay in 
the high correlation among the collected wavelengths, necessitating the identification of the optimal method to ensure the utmost precision in our predictions. Furthermore, the 
study faced constraints due to the limited number of samples available, comprising a total of 151 samples from four different depths within the field.
Here, I present a portion of the code developed to predict Soil Organic Carbon, employing the LASSO regressor. This approach aimed to pinpoint the most pertinent features, thereby 
enhancing prediction accuracy while minimizing bias in our estimations. It's worth noting that Soil Organic Carbon presents one of the most formidable properties to forecast accurately.
